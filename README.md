# jwd-extra-activities
These activities are designed to challenge you. They each come with a solved folder, but try not to use it until you have gotten stuck, tried to research a way to get unstuck and still cannot figure it out.

These will give you a chance to work on code on your own computer, get used to linking files and running them in the browser. It will give you a chance to get to know the "console" and other parts of your devTools that are built into browsers.
